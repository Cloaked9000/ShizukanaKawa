## Episode list screen:

The episode list is displayed when a season entry is clicked (from within either the home screen, or the history screen), and contains a searchable list of episodes within the selected season. The ticks indicate that the episode has previously been watched. This flag can be unset by right clicking on the entry. Clicking an entry will start playing it, whilst also adding the current season to the history list.
